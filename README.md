# üëã Hi there

I'm devopscodeck (or Sierra Curupira), devops engineer and tech enthusiast. I currently work as a DevSecOps Engineer.  
With over 6 years of experience in the field, I've had the opportunity to work on various exciting projects and explore different technologies.

# üöÄ Expertise
Driven by a passion for delivering secure, scalable, and efficient software, I specialize in DevSecOps practices that integrate development, security, and operations. With nearly 6 years of experience in this multidisciplinary field, I have supervised the automation of pipelines, implemented security best practices, and ensured high availability and performance in production environments.

Throughout my professional journey, I have assumed the role of DevSecOps Technical Lead. In this capacity, my technical acumen has been crucial in guiding teams through the complexities of modern software delivery. I have focused not only on automating and securing workflows but also on fulfilling leadership responsibilities, providing strategic oversight, and ensuring that projects are executed in a timely and secure manner.

In the realm of professional development, I have also been a "content creator," focusing on the nuances of DevSecOps.

Outside the professional sphere, my passion takes a unique form: developing open-source tools with a focus on security and participating in CTF (Capture The Flag) championships. This venture not only sharpens my technical skills but also provides a platform where I can contribute to the community, bridging the gap between security and DevOps in a manner that is both educational and engaging.
